 For our project, we have decided we are going to compare the performance of two different object detection algorithm approaches.
 For the first one, we are going to create our own network using PyTorch, while for the second one, will use a fine-tuned version of an already existing architecture: YoloV8.
 We will be doing all this for two different datasets as we are striving to get the maximum grade of the project corresponding to: 5 - Using two datasets and two different algorithms.

 The file "object_detection_pytorch.ipynb", contains the code for the network created with Pytorch, and what remains now is doing the one with the fine-tuned version of YoloV8.
